    <h1>OpenTrail - Freemap for Android</h1>
    <p>OpenTrail is an Android app showing OpenStreetMap-based walkers' maps of England and Wales,
        highlighting the rights of way and showing contours.
        It provides many of the features of a
        typical OSM mobile app, but with a few specific features, in particular the
        ability to record walking routes report path problems and add points of interest and path directions
        in the field, as well as present these notes live to you in the field. and "play back"
        other users' walking routes, while you are out walking.</p>
    <p>OpenTrail is closely associated with the <a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk'>Freemap</a>
    website; it uses the same colour scheme, and map data, notes and walking routes are obtained
    from, and uploaded to, the Freemap server.</p>

    <h2> What can you do with OpenTrail?</h2>
    <ul style="margin-left: 10px">
        <li>View OpenStreetMap-derived
            maps of England and Wales, showing public rights of way in the
            same colour scheme as Freemap itself:
                <ul>
                    <li>green = public footpath;</li>
                    <li>brown = public bridleway;</li>
                    <li>red = byway or restricted byway</li>
                </ul>
            together with Ordnance Survey LandForm PANORAMA contours. The maps are
            rendered using the <a href='https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm'>VTM</a> library.
            You will need an internet connection initially, as
                the map data is downloaded from the Freemap server, but then the maps are
            saved on the device so you will be able to use them without an internet
            connection. <strong>A good approach is to download the maps of your chosen area before you go out
            (using the search facility if needed) and then you'll be able to view them without an
            internet connection.</strong></li>
        <li>Locally saved map data can be cleared with the <strong>Clear map cache now</strong> option. In
        that way, you can force OpenTrail to download new map data and keep up-to-date with the
        latest OpenStreetMap maps. You can also set the cache to auto-clear every so many days
        in the settings.</li>
        <li>Add notes to the map in-the-field, which will be then visible to other users both
            in OpenTrail and in Freemap. There are three categories of notes you can add:
                <ul>
                    <li>Footpath problems (e.g. blocked paths, muddy, mad cows etc);</li>
                    <li>Path directions, at places where the path is unclear;</li>
                    <li>General points of interest.</li>
                    </ul>
            These notes are added to Freemap's annotations database. It's my aim with Freemap and OpenTrail to produced a
            crowd-sourced source of information for walkers throughout the country. Note that you
            have to provide your Freemap login details in the settings (sign up
            <a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/fm/user.php?action=signup'>here</a>), otherwise
            the notes will have to be authorised before going live.</li>
        <li>Notes can be saved on the device for later upload, reducing the need
            for network access in-the-field. This can be chosen via the settings; when
        you return to an area with network access, you can then select
        <strong>Upload saved notes</strong> to upload them to Freemap.</li>
        <li>View notes in the field contributed by other
            users. When you pass a point annotated with a note, an alert window will appear
            presenting you with the details of that note.
            So, if you find yourself in the middle of a large field with no
            apparent way out, and someone else has contributed directions,
            OpenTrail will tell you where to aim for!</li>
        <li>Record walking routes and save them as GPX files. These can be
        uploaded to Freemap and shared with other users. As well as recording the walking
        route itself, you can add instructions; you do this by adding a note, as above, and
        specifying that you want the note to be added to the walk route.</li>
        <li>Download, find and <em>"play"</em>
            existing walking routes from Freemap (contributed both via OpenTrail and via the
            Freemap website itself). You need to download the list of walking routes first
                with the <strong>"Download list of walk routes"</strong> option, then
        select <strong>"Choose walk route"</strong> to find nearby routes.
        Once you've selected a route, you can "play" it: as you progress through the walking
        route, the notes associated with that route will pop up as you reach them!</li>
        <li>Find nearby points of interest (but that's pretty standard for an
            OSM mobile app). The POIs are obtained from the Freemap server. In the settings you
        can choose whether POIs will be automatically downloaded; if not, you'll have to
        download them manually with the <strong>Download POIs</strong> option before you
        can find them.</li>
    </ul>
